pandoc-opml
===========

pandoc-opml is a utility that generates [OPML][] files with the help
of [pandoc][].

I've long been interested in OPML as a file format, but I was always
more comfortable using a text editor than any of the available OPML
editors.

So I started toying with the idea of using a regular text editor and
exporting plain text files to OPML instead of editing OPML
directly.

I knew the hardest part was going to be parsing the plain text input
files. Looking for alternatives to writing that code myself, I found
pandoc and was thrilled to see it provided access to the abstract
syntax tree (AST) that represented the input file's headers,
paragraphs, list items, etc. Plus, by using pandoc, I could write the
input files in any of the [many file formats it understands][inputs].

After a weekend of hacking, `pandoc-opml` was born. Here's how to
run it:

    $ pandoc-opml [-o <output.opml>] <input.txt>

If `-o/--output` is not provided, the output is written to stdout.

Here's a super simple demo:

```bash
$ cat > test.md
% Demo for the README
% Eric Davis
  
# Hello World!

This paragraph is a child of the "Hello World!" header.
EOF
$ pandoc-opml -o test.opml test.md && xmllint -format test.opml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<opml version="2.0">
